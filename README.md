# Sidebar

This project is a SwiftUI-based macOS application that explores sidebar navigation patterns. It demonstrates how to implement and manage a sidebar for navigating between different sections of a Mac app, such as Home, Documents, Favorites, Profile, and Settings.

## Features

- Sidebar navigation using SwiftUI
- Multiple views: Home, Documents, Favorites, Profile, Settings
- Simple navigation model and view routing
- Modular code structure for easy exploration and extension

## Project Structure

- `ContentView.swift`: Main view containing the sidebar and navigation logic
- `Utils/ViewRouter.swift`: Utility for routing between views
- `Views/`: Contains individual views for each section
- `Assets.xcassets/`: App icons and accent colors
- `Sidebar.entitlements`: App entitlements for macOS

## Getting Started

1. Open `Sidebar.xcodeproj` in Xcode
2. Build and run the app on macOS
3. Explore the sidebar navigation and switch between different sections

## Motivation

This project is intended for learning and experimentation with sidebar navigation in macOS apps using SwiftUI. It can serve as a reference or starting point for your own projects.
